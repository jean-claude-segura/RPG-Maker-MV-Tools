A1 and A2 are 512 x 384 pixels
A3 is 512 x 256 pixels
A4 is 512 x 480 pixels
A5 is 256 x 512 pixels
B-E Tilesets are 512 x 512 pixels.

MV
A1 and A2 are 768 x 576 pixels
A3 is 768 x 384 pixels
A4 is 768 x 720 pixels
A5 is 384 x 768 pixels
B-E Tilesets are 768 x 768 pixels.

The MV individual tiles are 48x48 instead of Ace's 32x32, so multiply the dimensions of each tileset image by 1.5 to get the MV measurements.

Basically, you have numTiles =  width * height
There are 6 layers, each layer with numTiles values
The array is width * height * 6
First 4 layers represent tile ID's, layer 5 is shadows, layer 6 is region.
The tile ID's are internal tile ID's that the tilemap uses to determine which bitmap to draw, and how to draw it (in the case of auto-tiles)
The format for the tile ID's is similar to what you had in VX/Ace, where 0 to 1024 are for pages B-E, and everything beyond that is for autotiles.
